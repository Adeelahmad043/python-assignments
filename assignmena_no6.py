Question 1:
Define Object Oriented Programming Language?

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",
which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.
A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data 
fields of the object with which they are associated.

Question 2:
List down the Benefits of OOP?
Advantages of OOP

Object-Oriented Programming:
OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining 
abstract datatypes where implementation details are hidden and the unit has a clearly 
defined interface.
OOP makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can
 be created with small differences to existing ones.
OOP provides a good framework for code libraries where supplied software
components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly
useful for developing graphical user interfaces

Question 3:
Differentiate between function and method?
Python method is called on an object, unlike a function. ... Since we call a method on an 
object, it can access the data within it. A method may alter an object's state, but Python 
function usually only operates on it, and then prints something or returns a value.

Question 4:
Define the following terms:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Attribute
4. Behavior

class:
a class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it: it describes an aggregate 
of data fields (called instance variables), and defines the operations (called methods).
object:
an object is an element (or instance) of a class; objects have the behaviors of their 
class. The object is the actual component of programs, while the class specifies how 
instances are created and how they behave.
method:
a method is an action which an object is able to perform.
sending a message
sending a message to an object means asking the object to execute or invoke one of its methods
attribute:
An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object. ... A 
class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular 
object. It is shared between all the objects of this class and it is defined outside the 
constructor function, __init__(self,...) , of the class.
Question 5:
Write a code in python in which create a class named it Car which
have 5 attributes such like (model, color and name etc.) and 3
methods. And create 5 object instance from that class.
